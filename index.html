<p>"Remember, remember the fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot."
A frightening and powrful tale of the loss of freedom and identitiy in a chillingly believable totalitarian world, V for Vendetta stands as one of the highest achievements of the comics medium and a defining work for creators Alan Moore and David Lloyd.
Set in an imagined future england thast has given itself over to facism, this groundbreaking story captures both the suffocating nature of life in an authoritarian police state and the redemptive powwer of teh human spirit which rebels against it. Crafted with sterling clarity and intelligence, V for vendetta brings and unequaled deth of characterisation and varisimilitude to its unflinching account of oppression and resistance.
