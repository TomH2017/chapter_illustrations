        <h1>V for Vendetta</h1>
        <h2>A story of anarchy and revolution.</h2>
        <h3>Wrtitten by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd (with additional art by Tony Weare.)</h3>
        <p class="main ">
            <q>"Remember, remember the fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot."</q>
            A frightening and powerful tale of the loss of freedom and identitiy in a chillingly believable totalitarian world, V for Vendetta stands as one of the highest achievements of the comics medium, and a defining work for creators Alan Moore and David Lloyd.
            Set in an imagined future England thast has given itself over to facism, this groundbreaking story captures both the suffocating nature of life in an authoritarian police state and the redemptive power of the human spirit which rebels against it. Crafted with sterling clarity and intelligence, V for Vendetta brings and unequaled depth of characterisation and varisimilitude to its unflinching account of oppression and resistance.

            <h1>Final Chapter Illustrations</h1>
            <h3>"Chapter 2: The Voice"</h3>

            <p>
                When creating this illustration I took the chapter into account but also took it very literally, I did this because i thought by doing this it would have the most effect upon someone seeing it. In the book, the voice is an automated computer voice that sends messages to the people to keep them under the control of the government knowing this, having a voice projected from a speaker seemed like a good option for an image.
            </p>

            <h3>"Chapter 3: Victims"</h3>
            <p>
                Likewise, when creating the cover for chapter 3, I took it literally, but also used V's vendetta against the scientists that experimented on him as a basis for the illustration, with him targeting and taking out each scientist one by one, thus being a victim of his vendetta.
                I also used a scene in Harry Potter as a basis for this chapter, in the final film, Harry finds a file containing a list of all the muggle born wizards that have been killed, as well as other wizards that are on the list to be killed.
            </p>

            <h3>"Chapter 6: Vision"</h3>
            <p> 
                For this illustration, I started considering the contents of the chapter but discarded the sketch as I thought I could create better ideas with more inspiration. I then created a sketch based upon vision, the sense, as in sight, but wasn't keen on it so created this sketch which uses vision as in someone seeing a vision of previous events in the book.

            <h1>Chapter Summaries</h1>
            <h2>"Chapter 1: The Villain"</h2>
            <h3><q>"Remember, Remember, The Fifth of November…"</q></h3>
            <p> 
                The book opens on November 5th, 1997 (in an alternate distopian world) in London, England. A radio programme called The Voice of Fate broadcasts party propaganda as the working class pours out of a factory under the watchful eye of video cameras and police officers. Meanwhile, Evey Hammond sits at her vanity mirror and applies copious amounts of make-up as the broadcast drones on. She wears a look of utter despair as she cakes on more and more make-up. Elsewhere, a shadowy figure approaches his own vanity in a room adorned with old movie posters. He dons a wig, a dark cloak, and a Guy Fawkes mask as The Voice of Fate broadcast ends.
                
                Evey wanders the streets as a prostitute, looking to supplement her meagre earnings as a labourer in munitions. However, it is her first night, and her inexperience leads her to propositioning a Fingerman, a representative of the brutal police state. The officer and his fellow Fingermen insinuate they plan to rape Evey before killing her. However, they are interrupted by the masked man, who uses tear gas and explosives to kill all but two of them, rescuing Evey.

                The masked man brings Evey to the rooftops, where he introduces himself as “the king of the Twentieth century,” “the bogeyman” and "the villain." He recites the rhyme "Remember, Remember, The Fifth of November," as the Parliament Building detonates in a volley of fireworks, for which the masked man takes credit. He says "the overture is finished" and that he and Evey must prepare for the first act, to which Evey meekly agrees.

            <h2>"Chapter 2: The voice"</h2>
            <h3><q>"…They eradicated some cultures more thoroughly than they did others."</q></h3>
            <p>
                The next morning, the omnipresent leader of the government holds a debriefing among the numerous surveillance cabinets in his party - The Eye (video surveillance), The Ear (phone tapping) and The Nose (investigative arm of the law). Lastly, he speaks with the head of The Finger, Derek Almond, who he blames for allowing the attack to occur. The leader says that the terrorist has “done the unthinkable” by actually damaging the party, and demands Derek bring him the terrorist’s head, and threatens Almond. The leader excuses Almond, and states that "England Prevails."

                Shortly after meeting with the Leader, Almond visits Jordan Tower, where The Voice of Fate radio programme is recorded. There he meets with Roger Dascombe, the programme's vulgar and effeminate technical supervisor. Almond wants to know what they plan on saying about the terrorist attack, and Dascombe says Lewis Prothero, the voice behind "The Voice of Fate," intends to call it  a "scheduled demolition" undergone at night to avoid traffic congestion. Here, it's revealed "The Voice of Fate" programme is a ruse - Prothero poses as the voice of the government's Fate computer system. He's also known to collect dolls, which disgusts Almond.

                Meanwhile, the masked terrorist has brought Evey to his underground catacomb, which he has dubbed "The Shadow Gallery." It serves as a monument to all the culture that existed before Norsefire eradicated all of it - film, literature, music and art. Evey is stunned by his collection, having grown up only hearing military music broadcast over the radio. The terrorist laments the loss of the arts, and makes a veiled threat to do something about it.

                Later, Prothero is being escorted via train by a pair of Fingermen. He enthusiastically blathers on about his doll collection to his escorts, who humour him and listen to his stories. Suddenly, the Fingermen see a dark figure outside the cabin shortly before the lights malfunction, leaving the trio in darkness. Prothero, unconcerned by the technical glitch, continues to talk until he pulls out a lighter and notices his escorts have been silently murdered. Then, to his shock, he is greeted by the masked terrorist sitting next to him with an unassuming "hello."
            </p>


            <h2>"Chapter 3: Victims"</h2>
            <h3><q>"I'm going to have to get right inside his head. To think the way he thinks. And that scares me."</q></h3>
            <p>
                Eric Finch of The Nose is investigating the train incident. The Fingermen are dead from wounds Finch suspects that whoever killed them “did it with their fingers.” Prothero has been kidnapped. On the cabin wall, the terrorist left a mark, a letter "V," and a Violet Carson, a breed of rose thought extinct. Finch interviews the conductor, but that proves to be of little help, as he was knocked out by the terrorist almost immediately, only catching a brief glimpse of a dark figure with a smiling face beforehand. Finch's assistant Dominic comments that “normal people” can’t do the things the terrorist can, and Finch agrees. Finch expresses concern that if the terrorist is mentally abnormal, then he will have to think as abnormally as he if he has any hope of catching him.

                Back in the Shadow Gallery, the terrorist leaves a room containing someone out cold in military garb to check up on Evey, who he finds sobbing by his vanity. The reality of her situation is hitting her and she finds herself shocked by how much her life has changed in a night. She asks her captor his name, and while he says he does not have one, he tells her she may call him "V," and asks after her name. She says she's “nobody special,” but V insists everyone is special and that he would like to hear her story. She recounts her childhood where she grew up in a time of global nuclear turmoil with her mom and dad.

                After a fierce nuclear war and much radical geographical upheaval (“Africa’s not there anymore”), Britain's government dissolves and roving gangs rule until the fascist Norsefire government takes control. Evey's mother dies of illness, and her father, who once belonged to a socialist group, is rounded up and taken to a concentration camp as the new government culls all potential sedition, leaving an orphaned Evey to work in a factory and live in a hostel. Her memories begin to overwhelm her, so V consoles her and reassures her that together, they can wipe away all the pain and suffering and begin anew.

                Elsewhere in the Shadow Gallery, Lewis Prothero, the man in the uniform, awakens to find himself in a recreation of someplace called Larkhill Resettlement Camp.
